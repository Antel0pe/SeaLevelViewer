how does water precipitate where it does to feed glaciers

what we know
- canada has lots of moisture, northern/western europe has lots, siberia doesnt

western coasts have high evaporation due to coriolis vs eastern coasts
- equator water moves east to west with trade winds. it gets deflected right out of the equator to the north which ends up on western coast?
- this could explain apparent higher evaporation on west coasts of oceans

uv climatology mostly looks like
- mid latitude westerlies
- equator trades
- polar doesnt know what its doing
- regions of intermixing between the mid latitudes and trades both ways going north and south

east asia gets lots of precip somehow too but it doesnt get to siberia then?
- chatgpt says moisture is from southern ocean? apparently rains then gets pulled by westerlies

i guess simple way to model moisture transport is trade winds around equator say 20 to -20
transition zone 20-40 between trade and latitudes then 40-70 westerlies
transition zone would have curling flows where its either moving northward or southward. 
- although how would east asian moisture not curl downwards? why does it curl upwards?
