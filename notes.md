- blurring doesnt faithfully do moisture transportation since it averages things out rather than "using up" precip
- need to make moisture transport with djikstra legible
    - during djikstra record predecessors, path, etc
    - show a layer of moisture where it naturally shows moisture over ocean and fading areas over land and mountains
- djikstra would only find highest contributing pixels but there might be cases (greenland) where multiple oceans need to converge on a location to supply enough moisture. only one ocean would not supply sufficient moisture
- experiment with minimum ice needed to glaciate so non zero ice left after accum and melt might not be enough but minimum threshold like 0.05 or something
    - since siberia was cold enough and probably had non zero moisture but so little ice it couldnt start glaciating? dunno?
- making something explorable+explainable means it should be easy to debug too
    - if youre having a hard time debugging or figuring out why its doing something, you should make things that make it easier to see because it helps debug and the overall purpose
- maybe make some sort of "onboarding" experience that you can play that walks you through the different views and how the model decides how it comes to a decision. something cool to show the brains of how it works
